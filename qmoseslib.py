# Q-MOSES - A D-WAVE Mesh Partitioner
##########################################################
# This is the staff for you to use, Moses.
# Not developed by a good wind with good timing, or even
# divine intervention, but rather an understanding of
# fluid dynamics, applied mathematics, quantum mechanics,
# & computational complexity theory.
##########################################################
# Developed as part of the Honours Project by John Furness
# With generous in-kind support provided by QxBranch and Shoal Group
# August 2015
##########################################################
# For algorithm explanations and use cases, see attached documentation.
# Written to PEP8 Python standard.
# Requires:
# numpy, networkx, matplotlib, pyplot, dwave_sapi

# GRAPH PARTITION FUNCTION
# Imports a variety of graph/mesh/adjacency files, you give the number of partitions,
# whether to use local or remote solver,
# Partitions into any number of partitions
# sub functions include Lucas Hamiltonian for 2^N partitions
# Your own Hamiltonian for prime numbers etc etc

# FILL-REDUCING ORDERINGS FUNCTION FOR SPARSE MATRICES
# Using graph partitioning, or graph colouring methods, even clique methods

# MESSAGE SCHEDULING GRAPH COLOURING PROBLEM

# QUANTUM LATTICE GAS for FUN DEMONSTRATION perhaps
